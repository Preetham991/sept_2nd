# Email Confidence Score Generation and Evaluation: A Comprehensive Theoretical and Practical Guide

## Executive Summary

This report provides an exhaustive theoretical and practical framework for confidence score generation, calibration, and evaluation in multi-class email classification systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). We present a complete mathematical foundation, detailed experimental analysis, comprehensive comparison tables, and actionable practitioner guidelines. The analysis is grounded in a reproducible Python implementation that generates synthetic email data, computes confidence scores using multiple methods, applies various calibration techniques, and produces a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics and visualizations.

The key findings demonstrate that modern neural networks exhibit systematic overconfidence (optimal temperature scaling parameter T=1.8), with particularly severe miscalibration on minority classes (Forums class: 44% accuracy vs 73% confidence). Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we establish clear guidelines for confidence method selection, calibration technique application, and ongoing system monitoring.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Formulation {#introduction}

### 1.1 The Confidence Estimation Problem

In multi-class classification, we have a model $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \Delta^{K-1}$ that maps inputs $x \in \mathcal{X}$ to probability distributions over $K$ classes. The predicted class is typically $\hat{y} = \arg\max_k f_k(x)$, but the confidence in this prediction requires careful consideration.

**Formal Problem Statement**: Given a trained classifier $f$ and input $x$, we seek a confidence function $C: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that:

1. **Monotonicity**: Higher confidence should correlate with higher likelihood of correctness
2. **Calibration**: $P(\text{correct} | C(x) = c) = c$ for all confidence levels $c$
3. **Discrimination**: The confidence function should separate correct from incorrect predictions
4. **Computational Efficiency**: The confidence computation should be tractable for production systems

### 1.2 Email Classification Context

Email classification presents unique challenges:

- **Class Imbalance**: Spam dominates typical inboxes (30-40%), while specialized categories like Forums are rare (<5%)
- **Temporal Drift**: Email patterns evolve continuously, affecting both accuracy and calibration
- **Cost Asymmetry**: False positives (legitimate emails classified as spam) have higher cost than false negatives
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Confidence scores directly impact when human review is triggered

### 1.3 Contributions and Scope

This report provides:

- **Theoretical Framework**: Mathematical foundations for confidence scoring and calibration
- **Empirical Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation on synthetic email data with known characteristics
- **Practical Guidelines**: Actionable recommendations for method selection and implementation
- **Reproducible Implementation**: Complete Python codebase for experimentation and deployment

## 2. Dataset Design and Experimental Methodology {#dataset}

### 2.1 Synthetic Dataset Construction

Our experimental foundation is a carefully constructed synthetic dataset designed to capture the essential challenges of real-world email classification while maintaining full control over ground truth properties.

**Dataset Specifications:**

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Total Samples | 500 | Sufficient for statistical significance while computationally manageable |
| Number of Classes | 5 | Realistic complexity for email classification |
| Class Distribution | Imbalanced | Reflects real-world email patterns |

**Detailed Class Distribution:**

| Class Name | Sample Count | Percentage | Cumulative % | Design Rationale |
|------------|-------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Spam | 175 | 35.0% | 35.0% | Dominant class reflecting typical inbox patterns |
| Promotions | 125 | 25.0% | 60.0% | Large but secondary category, confusable with Spam |
| Social | 100 | 20.0% | 80.0% | Moderate frequency, confusable with Updates |
| Updates | 75 | 15.0% | 95.0% | Smaller category with moderate confusability |
| Forums | 25 | 5.0% | 100.0% | Minority class testing calibration robustness |

### 2.2 Data Generation Process

The synthetic data generation follows a principled approach to create realistic classification challenges:

**Step 1: Logit Generation**
For each sample $i$ with true class $y_i$, we generate pre-softmax logits $z_i \in \mathbb{R}^K$:

```
z_{i,y_i} ~ N(μ_correct, σ_correct²)  # Correct class logit
z_{i,j} ~ N(μ_incorrect, σ_incorrect²) for j ≠ y_i  # Incorrect class logits
```

**Step 2: Confusability Modeling**
To simulate realistic class confusions, we adjust logits for confusable pairs:

| Class Pair | Adjustment | Effect |
|------------|------------|---------|
| (Spam, Promotions) | Increase incorrect class logit by 1.3 | Higher confusion between commercial emails |
| (Social, Updates) | Increase incorrect class logit by 1.3 | Ambiguity between social notifications and updates |

**Step 3: Probability Computation**
Convert logits to probabilities using softmax:

$$p_{i,k} = \frac{\exp(z_{i,k})}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(z_{i,j})}$$

**Step 4: Miscalibration Injection**
To simulate neural network overconfidence, we artificially modify 30% of samples:

$$p'_{i,k} = \frac{p_{i,k}^{0.7}}{\sum_{j=1}^K p_{i,j}^{0.7}}$$

This transformation increases the maximum probability while preserving class rankings, mimicking the overconfidence typically observed in deep neural networks.

### 2.3 Ground Truth Analysis

**Theoretical Properties:**
- **Class Separability**: Controlled by the difference between $μ_correct$ and $μ_incorrect$
- **Inherent Difficulty**: Varies by class due to different confusability patterns
- **Calibration Baseline**: 70% of samples maintain original (well-calibrated) probabilities

**Expected Challenges:**
- Minority class (Forums) vulnerable to overconfidence due to limited training exposure
- Confusable pairs (Spam/Promotions, Social/Updates) will show intermediate confidence levels
- Artificially miscalibrated samples will exhibit systematic overconfidence patterns

## 3. Advanced Theoretical Foundations {#theory}

### 3.1 Information-Theoretic Foundations

#### 3.1.1 Entropy and Uncertainty Quantification

The Shannon entropy of a discrete probability distribution $P = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_K)$ is:

$$H(P) = -\sum_{k=1}^K p_k \log p_k$$

**Properties and Interpretation:**
- **Range**: $H(P) \in [0, \log K]$
- **Minimum**: $H(P) = 0$ when $P$ is deterministic (one class has probability 1)
- **Maximum**: $H(P) = \log K$ when $P$ is uniform ($p_k = 1/K$ for all $k$)
- **Concavity**: Entropy is concave, meaning that averaging distributions increases entropy

**Normalized Entropy Confidence:**
To create a confidence measure, we define:

$$C_{\text{entropy}}(x) = 1 - \frac{H(P(Y|x))}{\log K}$$

This normalization ensures $C_{\text{entropy}}(x) \in [0, 1]$ with:
- 0 indicating maximum uncertainty (uniform distribution)
- 1 indicating maximum confidence (deterministic prediction)

#### 3.1.2 Mutual Information and Confidence

The mutual information between predictions and true labels provides insight into confidence quality:

$$I(Y; \hat{Y}) = \sum_{y,\hat{y}} P(y, \hat{y}) \log \frac{P(y, \hat{y})}{P(y)P(\hat{y})}$$

Higher mutual information indicates that predictions are more informative about true labels, suggesting better confidence calibration.

### 3.2 Probability Calibration Theory

#### 3.2.1 Perfect Calibration Definition

A probabilistic classifier is perfectly calibrated if:

$$P(Y = \hat{y} | \hat{p} = p) = p \quad \forall p \in [0, 1]$$

where $\hat{p}$ is the predicted probability for the predicted class $\hat{y}$.

**Reliability Diagram Mathematics:**
For practical evaluation, we bin predictions by confidence level:

$$\text{Bin}_m = \{i : p_{\text{low}}^{(m)} < \max_k P(Y = k | x_i) \leq p_{\text{high}}^{(m)}\}$$

Within each bin, we compute:
- **Average Confidence**: $\bar{p}^{(m)} = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} \max_k P(Y = k | x_i)$
- **Accuracy**: $\text{acc}^{(m)} = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} \mathbf{1}[\hat{y}_i = y_i]$

Perfect calibration requires $\bar{p}^{(m)} = \text{acc}^{(m)}$ for all bins $m$.

#### 3.2.2 Brier Score Decomposition

The Brier Score for multiclass classification is:

$$\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K (\hat{p}_{i,k} - y_{i,k})^2$$

where $y_{i,k} = 1$ if sample $i$ belongs to class $k$, and 0 otherwise.

**Murphy's Decomposition:**
The Brier Score can be decomposed into three interpretable components:

$$\text{BS} = \text{Reliability} - \text{Resolution} + \text{Uncertainty}$$

where:

**Reliability (Calibration Error):**
$$\text{REL} = \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{|B_m|}{N} (\bar{p}^{(m)} - \text{acc}^{(m)})^2$$

**Resolution (Discrimination Ability):**
$$\text{RES} = \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{|B_m|}{N} (\text{acc}^{(m)} - \bar{\text{acc}})^2$$

**Uncertainty (Problem Difficulty):**
$$\text{UNC} = \bar{\text{acc}}(1 - \bar{\text{acc}})$$

### 3.3 Decision-Theoretic Foundations

#### 3.3.1 Bayes Optimal Decision Rule

Under the 0-1 loss function, the Bayes optimal classifier is:

$$f^*(x) = \arg\max_k P(Y = k | x)$$

The Bayes risk (minimum achievable error rate) is:

$$R^* = \int_{\mathcal{X}} \left(1 - \max_k P(Y = k | x)\right) P(x) dx$$

#### 3.3.2 Cost-Sensitive Extensions

For email classification with asymmetric costs, we define a cost matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}$ where $C_{i,j}$ is the cost of predicting class $j$ when the true class is $i$.

The optimal decision rule becomes:

$$f^*_{\text{cost}}(x) = \arg\min_j \sum_{i=1}^K C_{i,j} P(Y = i | x)$$

## 4. Confidence Scoring Methods: Theory and Practice {#confidence}

### 4.1 Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)

#### 4.1.1 Mathematical Foundation

For a classifier producing probability vector $p = (p_1, \ldots, p_K)$, the MSP confidence is:

$$C_{\text{MSP}}(x) = \max_{k=1,\ldots,K} p_k$$

**Theoretical Properties:**
- **Range**: $C_{\text{MSP}} \in [1/K, 1]$ for well-formed probabilities
- **Monotonicity**: Higher values indicate more confident predictions
- **Simplicity**: Single arithmetic operation

#### 4.1.2 Strengths and Limitations Analysis

| Aspect | Analysis | Quantitative Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **Computational Complexity** | O(K) - Linear in number of classes | ~0.001ms per prediction |
| **Calibration Quality** | Often poorly calibrated in neural networks | ECE typically 0.05-0.15 |
| **Discrimination Power** | Moderate ability to separate correct/incorrect | AUROC typically 0.65-0.80 |
| **Interpretability** | Direct probability interpretation | Intuitive for end users |
| **Robustness** | Sensitive to overconfident models | Vulnerable to temperature effects |

#### 4.1.3 When to Choose MSP

**Optimal Scenarios:**
- **Production Systems**: When computational efficiency is paramount
- **Well-Calibrated Models**: When the underlying model produces reliable probabilities
- **Baseline Establishment**: As a standard reference point for comparison
- **User-Facing Applications**: When interpretability is crucial

**Suboptimal Scenarios:**
- **Research Applications**: When theoretical rigor is required
- **Poorly Calibrated Models**: When systematic overconfidence is present
- **Multi-Class Uncertainty**: When fine-grained uncertainty analysis is needed

### 4.2 Entropy-Based Confidence

#### 4.2.1 Mathematical Foundation

The entropy-based confidence score is:

$$C_{\text{entropy}}(x) = 1 - \frac{H(P(Y|x))}{\log K}$$

where $H(P(Y|x)) = -\sum_{k=1}^K P(Y = k|x) \log P(Y = k|x)$.

**Information-Theoretic Interpretation:**
- Low entropy → High confidence (probability mass concentrated)
- High entropy → Low confidence (probability mass distributed)
- Normalization ensures comparability across different K values

#### 4.2.2 Computational Considerations

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time**: O(K) for entropy computation
- **Space**: O(1) additional storage
- **Numerical Stability**: Requires careful handling of log(0) cases

**Implementation Details:**
```python
def entropy_confidence(probabilities, epsilon=1e-8):
    """Compute entropy-based confidence with numerical stability."""
    probs_clipped = np.clip(probabilities, epsilon, 1.0)
    entropy = -np.sum(probs_clipped * np.log(probs_clipped), axis=1)
    max_entropy = np.log(probabilities.shape[1])
    return 1 - (entropy / max_entropy)
```

#### 4.2.3 Theoretical Advantages

| Advantage | Mathematical Basis | Practical Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Distributional Awareness** | Uses entire probability vector | Captures subtle uncertainty patterns |
| **Scale Invariance** | Normalized by log(K) | Comparable across different classification tasks |
| **Information Content** | Grounded in information theory | Theoretically principled uncertainty measure |
| **Sensitivity** | Responds to distribution shape | Detects overconfident multimodal distributions |

### 4.3 Margin-Based Confidence

#### 4.3.1 Mathematical Foundation

The margin-based confidence is defined as:

$$C_{\text{margin}}(x) = p_1 - p_2$$

where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the highest and second-highest probabilities, respectively.

**Geometric Interpretation:**
In probability simplex space, the margin measures the distance from the decision boundary between the top two classes.

#### 4.3.2 Decision Boundary Analysis

**Critical Points:**
- **Maximum Margin**: $C_{\text{margin}} = 1 - 1/K$ (one class probability 1, others 0)
- **Minimum Margin**: $C_{\text{margin}} = 0$ (tie between top two classes)
- **Binary Tie Point**: $C_{\text{margin}} = 2p_1 - 1$ when top two classes have equal probability

**Relationship to Classification Difficulty:**
Lower margins indicate:
- Ambiguous cases requiring human review
- Potential class confusability
- Higher likelihood of prediction errors

### 4.4 Advanced Confidence Methods

#### 4.4.1 Ensemble-Based Confidence

For an ensemble of $M$ models, the ensemble confidence can be computed using prediction variance:

$$C_{\text{ensemble}}(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K \text{Var}(\{f_m^{(k)}(x)\}_{m=1}^M)$$

**Theoretical Justification:**
- Higher prediction agreement → Higher confidence
- Model disagreement indicates epistemic uncertainty
- Captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty

#### 4.4.2 Bayesian Neural Network Confidence

Under Bayesian treatment, the predictive distribution is:

$$P(Y|x, \mathcal{D}) = \int P(Y|x, \theta) P(\theta|\mathcal{D}) d\theta$$

**Monte Carlo Estimation:**
$$\hat{P}(Y = k|x, \mathcal{D}) = \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^S P(Y = k|x, \theta_s)$$

where $\theta_s \sim P(\theta|\mathcal{D})$ are posterior samples.

## 5. Calibration Techniques: Mathematical Foundations {#calibration}

### 5.1 Temperature Scaling

#### 5.1.1 Mathematical Formulation

Temperature scaling applies a single parameter $T > 0$ to the logit outputs:

$$p_i^{\text{cal}} = \frac{\exp(z_i/T)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(z_j/T)}$$

**Parameter Interpretation:**
- $T = 1$: Original probabilities (no change)
- $T > 1$: "Softer" probabilities (reduces overconfidence)
- $T < 1$: "Harder" probabilities (increases confidence)

#### 5.1.2 Optimization Procedure

The optimal temperature is found by minimizing the negative log-likelihood on a held-out validation set:

$$T^* = \arg\min_T \sum_{i=1}^N \log p_{y_i}^{\text{cal}}(T)$$

**Gradient-Based Optimization:**
The gradient with respect to $T$ is:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial T} = \frac{1}{T^2} \sum_{i=1}^N \left(z_{i,y_i} - \sum_{j=1}^K p_{i,j}^{\text{cal}} z_{i,j}\right)$$

#### 5.1.3 Theoretical Properties

**Invariance Properties:**
- **Accuracy Preservation**: Temperature scaling does not change the predicted class rankings
- **Monotonicity**: Maintains the ordering of confidence scores
- **Universality**: Single parameter works across all classes and confidence levels

**Limitations:**
- **Uniform Assumption**: Assumes miscalibration is uniform across confidence levels
- **Global Parameter**: Cannot fix class-specific calibration errors
- **Limited Flexibility**: May underperform with complex miscalibration patterns

### 5.2 Platt Scaling

#### 5.2.1 Mathematical Formulation

Platt scaling fits a sigmoid function to the classifier outputs:

$$P_{\text{cal}}(Y = 1|f(x)) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(A f(x) + B)}$$

where $A$ and $B$ are parameters learned via maximum likelihood estimation.

#### 5.2.2 Parameter Estimation

The likelihood function for Platt scaling is:

$$\mathcal{L}(A, B) = \sum_{i=1}^N y_i \log P_{\text{cal}}(Y = 1|f(x_i)) + (1-y_i) \log(1 - P_{\text{cal}}(Y = 1|f(x_i)))$$

**Regularization:**
To prevent overfitting, especially with limited calibration data, we can add L2 regularization:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}(A, B) = \mathcal{L}(A, B) - \lambda (A^2 + B^2)$$

#### 5.2.3 Multi-Class Extension

For multi-class problems, Platt scaling can be applied in several ways:

**One-vs-Rest Approach:**
Apply binary Platt scaling to each class independently:

$$P_{\text{cal}}(Y = k|x) = \frac{\text{sigmoid}(A_k f_k(x) + B_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^K \text{sigmoid}(A_j f_j(x) + B_j)}$$

**Confidence Score Approach:**
Apply Platt scaling to the confidence score (e.g., MSP):

$$C_{\text{cal}}(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(A \cdot C_{\text{raw}}(x) + B)}$$

### 5.3 Isotonic Regression

#### 5.3.1 Mathematical Formulation

Isotonic regression finds the optimal monotonic function $g$ that minimizes:

$$\min_g \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - g(s_i))^2$$

subject to the constraint: $g(s_1) \leq g(s_2) \leq \ldots \leq g(s_n)$ for sorted scores $s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \ldots \leq s_n$.

#### 5.3.2 Pool-Adjacent-Violators Algorithm

The optimal solution can be computed efficiently using the Pool-Adjacent-Violators (PAV) algorithm:

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Sort training examples by confidence score
2. Initialize $g(s_i) = y_i$ for all $i$
3. While violations exist (i.e., $g(s_i) > g(s_{i+1})$ for some $i$):
   - Pool adjacent violating points
   - Set pooled value to average of pooled targets
4. Return the resulting step function

#### 5.3.3 Theoretical Guarantees

**Optimality:**
The PAV algorithm produces the globally optimal isotonic regression solution.

**Generalization:**
Under certain conditions, isotonic regression provides consistent estimates of the true calibration function.

**Flexibility vs. Overfitting Trade-off:**
- **Advantages**: Can fit any monotonic miscalibration pattern
- **Disadvantages**: May overfit with limited calibration data, producing non-smooth calibration maps

## 6. Evaluation Metrics: Comprehensive Framework {#metrics}

### 6.1 Calibration-Specific Metrics

#### 6.1.1 Expected Calibration Error (ECE)

**Mathematical Definition:**
$$\text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{|B_m|}{N} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|$$

where:
- $B_m$ is the set of samples in bin $m$
- $\text{acc}(B_m) = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} \mathbf{1}[\hat{y}_i = y_i]$
- $\text{conf}(B_m) = \frac{1}{|B_m|} \sum_{i \in B_m} \max_k p_{i,k}$

**Interpretation and Benchmarks:**

| ECE Range | Calibration Quality | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 0.00 - 0.02 | Excellent | Deploy with confidence |
| 0.02 - 0.05 | Good | Acceptable for most applications |
| 0.05 - 0.10 | Moderate | Consider calibration methods |
| 0.10 - 0.20 | Poor | Calibration required |
| > 0.20 | Very Poor | Extensive recalibration needed |

#### 6.1.2 Maximum Calibration Error (MCE)

**Mathematical Definition:**
$$\text{MCE} = \max_{m=1,\ldots,M} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|$$

**Complementary Analysis:**
While ECE provides an average calibration error, MCE identifies the worst-case calibration bin. The relationship between ECE and MCE reveals important system characteristics:

| ECE vs MCE Pattern | Interpretation | Action Required |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Low ECE, Low MCE | Well-calibrated overall | Minimal action |
| Low ECE, High MCE | Good average, but problem bins exist | Investigate specific confidence ranges |
| High ECE, Low MCE | Uniformly miscalibrated | Apply global calibration (temperature scaling) |
| High ECE, High MCE | Severely miscalibrated with problem areas | Comprehensive recalibration needed |

#### 6.1.3 Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE)

**Mathematical Definition:**
ACE uses equal-mass bins instead of equal-width bins to avoid sparse bin problems:

$$\text{ACE} = \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{1}{M} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|$$

where each $|B_m| = N/M$.

**Advantages over ECE:**
- More stable with limited data
- Less sensitive to binning strategy
- Better statistical properties

### 6.2 Proper Scoring Rules

#### 6.2.1 Brier Score Analysis

**Detailed Decomposition for Multi-Class:**
$$\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K (\hat{p}_{i,k} - \mathbf{1}[y_i = k])^2$$

**Per-Class Brier Score:**
$$\text{BS}_k = \frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i: y_i = k} \sum_{j=1}^K (\hat{p}_{i,j} - \mathbf{1}[j = k])^2$$

**Interpretation Table:**

| Brier Score Range | Quality Assessment | Typical Scenarios |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0.00 - 0.20 | Excellent | Well-calibrated, high-accuracy models |
| 0.20 - 0.40 | Good | Moderate accuracy with good calibration |
| 0.40 - 0.60 | Fair | Either poor accuracy or poor calibration |
| 0.60 - 0.80 | Poor | Significant accuracy and/or calibration issues |
| 0.80 - 2.00 | Very Poor | Severely miscalibrated or very low accuracy |

#### 6.2.2 Ranked Probability Score (RPS)

For ordered classes, the RPS extends the Brier Score:

$$\text{RPS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \left(\sum_{j=1}^k (\hat{p}_{i,j} - \mathbf{1}[y_i \leq k])\right)^2$$

### 6.3 Discrimination Metrics

#### 6.3.1 AUROC for Confidence

**Binary Classification Framework:**
Treat confidence scoring as a binary classification problem:
- Positive class: Correct predictions
- Negative class: Incorrect predictions
- Score: Confidence value

**Mathematical Definition:**
$$\text{AUROC} = P(C(x_{\text{correct}}) > C(x_{\text{incorrect}}))$$

**Interpretation Benchmarks:**

| AUROC Range | Discrimination Quality | Confidence Utility |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 0.90 - 1.00 | Excellent | Highly reliable for selective prediction |
| 0.80 - 0.90 | Good | Useful for confidence-based filtering |
| 0.70 - 0.80 | Moderate | Limited utility, needs improvement |
| 0.60 - 0.70 | Poor | Minimal discriminative power |
| 0.50 - 0.60 | Very Poor | No better than random |

#### 6.3.2 Risk-Coverage Analysis

**Mathematical Framework:**
For coverage level $\tau \in [0, 1]$, define:
- Coverage: $\text{Cov}(\tau) = \tau$
- Risk: $\text{Risk}(\tau) = \frac{\sum_{i \in S_\tau} \mathbf{1}[\hat{y}_i \neq y_i]}{|S_\tau|}$

where $S_\tau$ is the set of top $\tau \cdot N$ most confident predictions.

**Selective Prediction Metrics:**
- **Risk at Coverage c**: Error rate when accepting top c% of predictions
- **Coverage at Risk r**: Maximum coverage while maintaining error rate ≤ r
- **Area Under Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC)**: Overall selective prediction quality

### 6.4 Information-Theoretic Metrics

#### 6.4.1 Mutual Information Between Confidence and Correctness

$$I(C; Y_{\text{correct}}) = \sum_{c,y} P(c, y) \log \frac{P(c, y)}{P(c)P(y)}$$

**Practical Computation:**
Use histogram-based estimation with appropriate binning strategy.

#### 6.4.2 Conditional Entropy

**Entropy of Correctness Given Confidence:**
$$H(Y_{\text{correct}} | C) = -\sum_{c} P(c) \sum_{y} P(y|c) \log P(y|c)$$

Lower conditional entropy indicates that confidence is more informative about correctness.

## 7. Experimental Results: In-Depth Analysis {#results}

### 7.1 Overall Performance Metrics

#### 7.1.1 Primary Metrics Table

| Metric | Value | Interpretation | Benchmark Comparison |
|--------|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.7320 | 73.2% correctly classified | Above average for 5-class problem |
| **Negative Log-Likelihood** | 1.1492 | High uncertainty in probability assignments | Indicates calibration issues |
| **Brier Score** | 0.3478 | Moderate combined accuracy/calibration | Room for improvement |
| **Expected Calibration Error** | 0.0624 | 6.24% average calibration gap | Moderate miscalibration |
| **Maximum Calibration Error** | 0.2829 | 28.29% worst-case calibration gap | Severe bin-specific issues |
| **AUROC (Confidence)** | 0.7423 | Fair discrimination ability | Useful but not excellent |
| **Sharpness** | 0.7302 | Average confidence level | Well-matched to accuracy |

#### 7.1.2 Detailed Interpretation

**Accuracy vs Confidence Analysis:**
The close match between accuracy (73.2%) and average confidence (73.0%) suggests reasonable global calibration, but the significant ECE (6.24%) reveals that this match doesn't hold across all confidence levels.

**Calibration Error Analysis:**
The large gap between ECE (6.24%) and MCE (28.29%) indicates that most confidence bins are reasonably well-calibrated, but at least one bin exhibits severe miscalibration. This pattern suggests the need for targeted calibration rather than global recalibration.

**Log-Likelihood Analysis:**
The relatively high NLL (1.1492) compared to the accuracy suggests that the model is not assigning sufficiently high probabilities to correct classes, even when it predicts them correctly. This is characteristic of underconfident probability assignments relative to actual performance.

### 7.2 Per-Class Performance Analysis

#### 7.2.1 Comprehensive Per-Class Metrics

| Class | Accuracy | Avg Confidence | Confidence-Accuracy Gap | Sample Count | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Spam** | 0.8114 | 0.7588 | -0.0526 | 175 | 0.8456 | 0.8114 | 0.8281 |
| **Promotions** | 0.6080 | 0.7093 | +0.1013 | 125 | 0.6102 | 0.6080 | 0.6091 |
| **Social** | 0.8100 | 0.7103 | -0.0997 | 100 | 0.7838 | 0.8100 | 0.7967 |

| **Forums** | 0.4400 | 0.7317 | +0.2917 | 25 | 0.5238 | 0.4400 | 0.4783 |

#### 7.2.2 Class-Specific Analysis

**Spam (Majority Class):**
- **Performance**: Excellent accuracy (81.1%) with appropriate confidence (75.9%)
- **Calibration**: Slight underconfidence (-5.26%), which is preferable to overconfidence
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk class - reliable predictions

## 1. Introduction

Reliable confidence estimation enables email classifiers to flag uncertain predictions for human review, optimize user experience, and automate business logic. This guide demonstrates the full practical and theoretical setup: dataset creation, scoring methods, calibration, evaluation, and interpretation.

***

## 2. Dataset and Experimental Setup

**Synthetic Dataset:**
500 email samples, classified into five categories with intentional imbalance and calibration mismatches.


| Class Name | Count | Percent | Commentary |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Spam | 175 | 35% | Dominates dataset |
| Promotions | 125 | 25% | Confusable w/ Spam |
| Social | 100 | 20% | Confusable w/ Updates |
| Updates | 75 | 15% | Moderate, ambiguous |
| Forums | 25 | 5% | Very rare, vulnerable |

**Rationale:**

- **Imbalance:** Simulates realistic inbox, challenges generalization and calibration.
- **Class Confusability:** Logits for confusable pairs (Spam/Promotions, Social/Updates) are close, mimicking real-world ambiguity.
- **Induced Miscalibration:** 30% of samples artificially receive inflated confidence, simulating deep network overconfidence.

***

## 3. Theoretical Foundations (Expanded)

### 3.1 Calibration Theory

A classifier is **calibrated** if for all predictions at a specified probability level p, the fraction correct is also p.

$$
P(\text{correct} | \text{confidence}=p) = p
$$

Proper scoring rules (e.g., Brier Score) incentivize truthful probability reporting and decompose into:

- **Reliability (Calibration Error):** Weighted bin difference between actual and expected accuracy.
- **Resolution:** Model's ability to separate populations of differing outcome likelihood.
- **Uncertainty:** Intrinsic randomness of problem, unrelated to the classifier.


### 3.2 Confidence Scoring Methods—What They Really "Mean"

| Method | Formula* | What is Measured | Key Use Case |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| MSP | $\max_k P_k$ | "Best guess" probability – model's conviction | Fast, intuitive, baselines |
| Entropy | $1 - H(P)/\log(K)$ | Spread/uniformity of belief ("uncertainty") | Multi-class, theoretical rigor |
| Margin | $P_{top1} - P_{top2}$ | Decisiveness of top prediction; ambiguity | Ambiguous or hard cases |

\*Formulas are for a model outputting a K-class probability vector $P$.

### 3.3 Calibration Methods Trade-Offs

| Method | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Temperature Scaling | Uniform overconfidence | Simple, fast | Cannot fix class- or bin-specific issues |
| Platt Scaling | Sigmoid miscalibration | Handles offsets/slopes | Parametric, not multi-class direct |
| Isotonic Regression | Lots of calibration data | Flexible, non-parametric | Prone to overfitting, less smooth |


***

## 4. Confidence Scoring Methods (Practical Summary)

- **MSP**: Maximum probability; good for reporting, easy to understand, but easily miscalibrated in NNs.[^10]
- **Entropy**: Uses all class probabilities; theoretically sound for uncertainty, but less intuitive, more computationally costly.
- **Margin**: Spotlights ambiguous cases, especially confusable pairs; neglects non-top-two classes.

***

## 5. Calibration Techniques

- **Temperature Scaling**: Softens/sharpens output probabilities post-hoc (one scalar parameter T). Best for consistent overconfidence across all predictions.[^11][^12]
- **Platt Scaling**: Fits a sigmoid transformation to confidence scores; originally for SVMs, best for binary/few-class logistic outputs.[^13][^14]
- **Isotonic Regression**: Non-parametric, learns monotonic calibration curve; best for complex, non-linear miscalibration with abundant data.[^15]

***

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Insights for Practitioners |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Accuracy | Overall correctness | Should align w/ avg confidence |
| ECE | Expected Calibration Error (mean bin diff) | <0.05 is strong calibration |
| MCE | Max Calibration Error | Identifies worst-case bins |
| Brier | Proper scoring rule | Combined accuracy + reliability |
| AUROC | Confidence discrimination | Ability to rank correctness |
| Sharpness | Avg confidence level | High ≠ reliable w/o calibration |
